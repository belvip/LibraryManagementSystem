# üìö Library Management System - Model Package Overview

The `com.belvinard.libraryManagementSystem.model` package contains the core classes that represent the data and functionality of the library system. Below are the key components of this package:

## 1. Book Class üìñ

The `Book` class represents a book in the library. It contains attributes that define a book, such as the title, author, ISBN, publication year, and genre.

### Key Features:
- **Attributes**:
  - `title`: The title of the book. üìñ
  - `author`: The name of the author. üßë‚Äçüè´
  - `ISBN`: The ISBN number (validated to be a 5-digit number).
  - `publicationYear`: The year the book was published (validated to be within a valid range).
  - `genre`: The genre of the book (validated to be one of the predefined genres).

- **Methods**:
  - `setISBN`: Validates that the ISBN is a 5-digit number.
  - `setPublicationYear`: Validates that the year is within a valid range (1000 to current year).
  - `setAuthor`: Validates that the author's name contains only alphabetic characters and spaces.
  - `setTitle`: Validates that the title is at least 3 characters long and contains only valid characters.
  - `setGenre`: Validates that the genre is one of the allowed genres (e.g., Fiction, Non-Fiction, etc.).

- **Additional Features**:
  - **Linked list for managing borrow history**: Each time a book is borrowed, a new record is added.
  - Method to **add borrow records** and **retrieve the borrow history**.


## 2. BorrowHistory Class üßæ

The `BorrowHistory` class keeps track of the borrowing history for a book. It stores the name of the borrower and links to the next borrow record.

### Key Features:
- **Attributes**:
  - `borrowerName`: The name of the person who borrowed the book.
  - `next`: A reference to the next borrow record (forming a linked list).

- **Methods**:
  - **Constructor**: Validates that `borrowerName` is not null or empty and uses a regex to ensure the name contains only valid characters (letters, spaces, and hyphens).
